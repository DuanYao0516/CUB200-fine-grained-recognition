# Project Description

This project is a project for the "Artificial Neural Networks" course at Sun Yat-sen University, which implements fine-grained bird recognition on the CUB200 dataset.

Use parameter adjustment, pre-training fine-tuning, VLM, ViT, change loss function, data enhancement (traditional image methods, DM, GAN), and study robustness and interpretability.

For specific technical details, please refer to the README_NOTE.md document

For the full report, please refer to the Enhancements in Neural Networks for Fine-grained Classification PDF file.
